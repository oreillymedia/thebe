<h1>Three-dimensional Plotting in Matplotlib</h1>

<p>Matplotlib was designed to be a two-dimensional plotting library.
Around the time of the 1.0 release, some 3D plotting utilities were built on top of matplotlib's 2D display, and the result is a convenient (if somewhat limited) set of tools for three-dimensional data visualization.
3D plots are enabled by importing the <code>mplot3d</code> submodule:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
</pre>

<p>Once this submodule is imported, a three-dimensional axes can be created by passing the keyword <code>projection='3d'</code> to any of the normal axes creation routines:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
</pre>

<p>With this 3D axes enabled, we can now plot a variety of three-dimensional plot types, as we'll see below.
Three-dimensional plotting is one of the functionalities which benefits immensely from viewing figures interactively rather than statically in the notebook; recall that to use interactive figures, you can either run a stand-alone Python script with the <code>plt.show()</code> command, or in the IPython notebook switch to the non-inline backend using the magic command <code>%matplotlib</code> rather than the usual <code>%matplotlib inline</code>.</p>
<section data-type='sect1'>
<h1>3D Points and Lines</h1>

<p>The most basic 3D plot is a line or collection of scatter plot created from sets of (x, y, z) triples.
In analogy with the more common two-dimensional discussed earlier, these can be created using the <code>ax.plot3D</code> and <code>ax.scatter3D</code> functions.
The call signature for these is nearly identical to that of their two-dimensional counterparts, so you can refer to recipe X.X for more information on controlling the output.
Here we'll plot a trigonometric spiral, along with some data drawn about the line:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')

# Data for a 3D line
zline = np.linspace(0, 15, 1000)
xline = np.sin(zline)
yline = np.cos(zline)
ax.plot3D(xline, yline, zline, 'gray')

# Data for 3D scattered points
zdata = 15 * np.random.random(100)
xdata = np.sin(zdata) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)
ydata = np.cos(zdata) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100)
ax.scatter3D(xdata, ydata, zdata, c=zdata, cmap='Greens');
</pre>

<p>Notice that by default, the scatter points have their transparency adjusted to give a sense of depth on the page.
While the 3D effect is sometimes difficult to see within a static image, an interactive view can lead to some nice intuition about the layout of the points.</p>
</section>
<section data-type='sect1'>
<h1>3D Contour Plots</h1>

<p>Analogous to the contour plots we explored briefly in recipe X.X, <code>mplot3d</code> contains tools to create three-dimensional relief plots using the same inputs.
Like two-dimensional <code>ax.contour</code> plots, <code>ax.contour3D</code> requires all the input data to be in the form of two-dimensional regular grids, with the Z data evaluated at each point.
Here we'll show a 3D contour diagram of a three-dimenisonal sinusoidal function:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
def f(x, y):
    return np.sin(np.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2))

x = np.linspace(-6, 6, 30)
y = np.linspace(-6, 6, 30)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = f(X, Y)
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.contour3D(X, Y, Z, 50, cmap='binary')
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_zlabel('z');
</pre>

<p>Sometimes the default viewing angle is not optimal; in this case we can use the <code>view_init</code> method to set the elevation and azimuthal angles. Here we'll use an elevation of 60 degrees (that is, 60 degrees above the x-y plane) and an azimuth of 35 degrees (that is, rotated 35 degrees counter-clockwise about the z-axis):</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
from IPython.html.widgets import interact

def animate(elevation=60,azimuth=30):
   ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
   ax.view_init(elevation, azimuth)
   ax.contour3D(X, Y, Z, 50, cmap='binary')
   ax.set_xlabel('x')
   ax.set_ylabel('y')
   ax.set_zlabel('z');
   ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='black')

interact(animate, el=(-90,90), az=(-90,90))
</pre>

<p>Again, note that this type of rotation can be accomplished interactively by clicking and dragging when using one of matplotlib's interactive backends.</p>
</section>
<section data-type='sect1'>
<h1>Wireframes and Surface Plots</h1>

<p>Two other types of 3D plots which work on gridded data are wireframes and surface plots.
These take a grid of values and project it onto the specified three-dimensional surface, and can make the resulting three-dimensional forms quite easy to visualize:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='black')
ax.set_title('wireframe');
</pre>

<p>A surface plot is like a wireframe plot, but each face of the wireframe is a filled polygon.
Adding a colormap to the filled polygons can aid perception of the topology of the surface being visualized:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1,
                cmap='cubehelix', edgecolor='none')
ax.set_title('surface');
</pre>

<p>Note that though the grid of values for a surface plot needs to be two-dimensional, it need not be rectilinear.
Here is an example of creating a partial polar grid, which when used with the <code>surface3D</code> plot can give us a slice into the function we're visualizing:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
r = np.linspace(0, 6, 20)
theta = np.linspace(-0.9 * np.pi, 0.8 * np.pi, 40)
r, theta = np.meshgrid(r, theta)

X = r * np.sin(theta)
Y = r * np.cos(theta)
Z = f(X, Y)

ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1,
                cmap='cubehelix', edgecolor='none');
</pre>

</section>
<section data-type='sect1'>
<h1>Surface Triangulations</h1>

<p>For some applications, the rectilinear grid required by the above routines is overly restrictive and inconvenient.
In these situations, the triangulation-based plots can be very useful.
What if rather than an even draw from a cartesian or a polar grid, we instead have a set of random draws?</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
theta = 2 * np.pi * np.random.random(1000)
r = 6 * np.random.random(1000)
x = np.ravel(r * np.sin(theta))
y = np.ravel(r * np.cos(theta))
z = f(x, y)
</pre>

<p>We could create a scatterplot of the points to get an idea of the surface we're sampling from:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.scatter(x, y, z, c=z, cmap='cubehelix', linewidth=0.5);
</pre>

<p>This leaves a lot to be desired.
The function that will help us in this case is <code>ax.plot_trisurf</code>, which creates a surface by first finding a set of triangles formed between adjacent points.
Remember that <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> here are one-dimensional arrays.</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_trisurf(x, y, z,
                cmap='cubehelix', edgecolor='none');
</pre>

<p>The result is certainly not as clean as when it is plotted with a grid, but the flexibility of such a triangulation allows for some really interesting 3D plots.
For example, it is actually possible to plot a 3D Mobius strip using this, as we'll see next.</p>
<section data-type='sect2'>
<h2>Triangulation Example: Creating A Mobius Strip</h2>

<p>The key to creating the mobius strip is to think about it's parametrization: it's a two-dimensional strip, so we need two intrinsic dimensions. Let's call them <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(\theta\)</span>, which ranges from <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(0\)</span> to <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(2\pi\)</span> around the loop, and <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(w\)</span> which ranges from -1 to 1 across the width of the strip.</p>
<p>Let's create this parametrization:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 30)
w = np.linspace(-0.25, 0.25, 8)
w, theta = np.meshgrid(w, theta)
</pre>

<p>Now from this parametrization, we must determine the <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\((x, y, z)\)</span> positions of the embedded strip.</p>
<p>The key to creating the mobius strip is to recognize that there are two rotations happening: one is the position of the loop about its center (what we've called <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(\theta\)</span>), while the other is the twisting of the strip about its axis (we'll call this <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(\phi\)</span>). For a Mobuis strip, we must have the strip makes half a twist during a full loop, or <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(\Delta\pi = \Delta\theta/2\)</span>.</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
phi = 0.5 * theta
</pre>

<p>Now we use simple geometry to derive the three-dimensional embedding.
We'll define <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\(r\)</span>, the distance of each point from the center, and use this to find the embedded <span class='math-tex' data-type='tex'>\((x, y, z)\)</span> coordinates:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
# radius in x-y plane
r = 1 + w * np.cos(phi)

x = np.ravel(r * np.cos(theta))
y = np.ravel(r * np.sin(theta))
z = np.ravel(w * np.sin(phi))
</pre>

<p>Finally, to plot the object, we must make sure the triangulization is correct. The best way to do this is to define the triangularization <em>within the underlying parametrization</em>, and then let matplotlib project this triangulation into the 3-dimensional space of the Mobius strip.
This can be accomplished as follows:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
# triangulate in the underlying parametrization
from matplotlib.tri import Triangulation
tri = Triangulation(np.ravel(w), np.ravel(theta))

ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_trisurf(x, y, z, triangles=tri.triangles,
                cmap='binary', linewidths=0.2);

ax.set_xlim(-1, 1); ax.set_ylim(-1, 1); ax.set_zlim(-1, 1);
</pre>

<p>Combining the above techniques, it is possible to create and display a wide variety of 3D objects and patterns in matplotlib.</p>
